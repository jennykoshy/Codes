//jshint esversion:6
const fs = require('fs'); 
//we get access to the node fs using the 'require' method. 
//so, there was a warning that File is a 'CommonJS' module. It can be converted to ES6 module, In Angel's atom terminal, the warning is "consyt ia availble only in ES6". I did a quicjk fix and the code changed to 'import fs from 'fs' instead of 'const fs = require('fs') . 
//I installed jshint.
